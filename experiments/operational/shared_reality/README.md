# CMR Experiment 1 — Shared Reality with Memory Asymmetry

This directory contains the first operational test of **shared reality under asymmetric memory regimes**.

## Description

In this experiment, multiple observers interact with the same medium while operating under different memory conditions. The test evaluates whether sharing the medium is sufficient to enforce a single objective reality.

## Core Result

- When observers share the same medium **and** have aligned memory regimes, divergence collapses (~0.0).
- When observers share the same medium but have **asymmetric memory**, divergence reappears (~0.24).
- The medium remains stable; divergence is reintroduced solely by observer memory.

## Conceptual Significance

This experiment demonstrates that:
- Shared access to the medium does not guarantee objective reality.
- Memory asymmetry is sufficient to generate incompatible local realities.
- No global collapse or contradiction occurs.

This experiment operationalizes the resolution of Wigner’s Friend-type paradoxes within the CMR framework.

## Status

Originally exploratory (`cmr_exp1`), later formalized as:
**Shared Reality Conditioned by Observer Memory**.
